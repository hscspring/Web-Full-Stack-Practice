Here are some notes on combining the Tk Event loop with the async lib
and/or Medusa.  Many thanks to Aaron Rhodes (alrhodes@cpis.net) for
the info!

  > 
  > in main:
  > import asyncore
  > 
  >     self.socket_check()
  >

  > then, socket_check() is:
  > 
  >     def socket_check(self):
  >         asyncore.poll(timeout=0.0)
  >         self.after(100, self.socket_check)
  > 
  > 
  > This simply causes asyncore to poll all the sockets every 100ms
  > during the tkinter event loop.  The GUI doesn't block on IO since
  > all the IO calls are now handled with asyncore.
